/* Getting somebody's history in, without making them watch.

   First run used to load three weeks in one go and hold the person on a progress screen
   until every message had been read, which could be half an hour. Now it is two parts:

   - quickStart: the most recent few days are loaded and the desk opens. Reading them is
     started but not waited for: a careful read of even twenty messages takes several
     minutes, and what it finds shows up on the desk as it goes.
   - catch-up: everything older, a few days at a time. It runs in the pod, not in this
     tab: the person's own `catch_up` schedule ticks a workflow whose first step loads the
     next slice and whose second reads it. Where it has got to lives in `settings` under
     `catchup`, so it carries on with the app closed. The Shell only watches (useCatchUp),
     groups what was read into topics, and switches the schedule off at the end.

   Mail is pulled in small slices because one function call that fetches a whole inbox
   outlives the 30 second request limit ("Mail: Request timed out after 30000ms"). */
