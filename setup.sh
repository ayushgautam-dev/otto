#    --with-files is not optional: Otto's whole judgement is /memory/AGENTS.md, and the
#    five skills ship as /setup/skills/. Without them every table, function and
#    workflow arrives intact and the assistant has no idea what it is for.
#
#    --with-data seeds exactly one table, autopilot_catalog — the menu of autopilots
#    everybody switches on for themselves. It holds no personal data. Every other
#    table arrives empty and fills with each person's own rows, private to them.
#
#    --set-pod-meta names the pod `Otto` (on Lemma the pod is the teammate, and its name is what the app calls it). It applies before any resource, so if
#    the organization already has a pod by that name it 409s in seconds with nothing
#    created — and the fallback is simply the same import without the rename.
#
#    The app slugs are named explicitly: they are unique across every pod on the
#    server, and the CLI's fallback is the pod id's first EIGHT hex characters, which
#    two pods created in the same moment share. The id's tail is random; use that.

 FOR YOU, NOT FOR THEM. Say the following in your own words, as one short
 message in prose. No command, no code block, no copy of this frame. They
 are very likely on a phone, and they did not ask for a terminal.
 (autopilot menu: $MENU entries — 0 means the import went in without
  --with-data and nobody gets autopilots · $BRAIN file(s) under /memory — 0 means
  without --with-files and Otto knows nothing · skills installed: $SKILLS of 5 ·
  log: $LOG)

 When they answer, YOU do the thing — never hand them a command:
   they want to start       -> send them to the app. First run is theirs: it
                               connects THEIR accounts and reads THEIR mail, as
                               them. You cannot do it for them, and must not try.
   a teammate wants in      -> add them to this pod. They open the same app and get
                               their own first run, autopilots and private data.
   they asked for a reply   -> write it as a draft. NEVER send it. Only their own
                               Send, in the app, sends anything.
   a schedule woke you      -> nobody is watching. Decide, and say what you assumed.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Otto is set up. It has read nothing yet — that starts when you open it.

  It reads your mail, calendar and meeting notes and works out what is still
  open: who is waiting on you, what you promised and by when, and what other
  people owe you. For the replies you owe, it writes the email in your voice
  before you ask. Nothing is ever sent until you press Send. Each morning it
  gives you one short brief instead of an inbox.

  To start, open it and connect Gmail — Calendar and Granola help, but are
  optional. The desk opens in about a minute; three weeks of history fill in behind it:
  $DESK_URL
  (the same pod, in a simpler layout: $APP_URL)

  Your team can have it too: add them to this pod and they open the same link.
  Their mail, their commitments and their autopilots stay private to them.
