# `apps/otto/source/` is a prebuilt static site — index.html and its assets, no
# package.json — and that is why a fresh pod imports in seconds: with a package.json
# there, every import runs npm and a Vite build that needs three VITE_LEMMA_* values a
# fresh pod has never had, fails at the app step (imported last), and takes the
# schedules and grants down with it. Built output is uploaded as-is.
#
# Nothing pod-specific may be baked in. The host injects window.__LEMMA_CONFIG__ when
# it serves the app, so the same bytes serve any pod. But Vite inlines VITE_LEMMA_*
# from the environment AND from .env files on disk, and this repository is public —
# so the variables are unset and any .env file is moved aside for the build.
