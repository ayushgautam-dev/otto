# Connect one source, end to end, from inside the product.
#
# The founder always finishes on the provider's own consent screen. This never
# sees or handles a credential — it only opens the door.
#
# The thing that makes this more than a one-liner: on a freshly cloned pod the
# organisation has **no connectors installed at all**. The bundle carries tables,
# functions, agents, workflows and the app, but not connector installs, because
# those live on the organisation rather than the pod. So the old version — which
# only looked an install up and gave up if it was missing — told every new owner
# to "add it from the Lemma connectors screen first". That is an admin console a
# person who just cloned a product should never have to find, and it is the whole
# reason this now installs before it connects.
#
# Three further things, each of which was a real bug:
#
# 1. The name in the UI is the *install* (auth config) name, not the connector id.
#    Granola is an install named "granola" on connector "mcp". Passing "granola"
#    as a connector id is a 404.
#
# 2. Whether a source can be authorised in a browser is decided by its **auth
#    scheme, never its kind**. The platform's own note on the field says it
#    plainly: "`mcp` is one catalog entry standing for every server a tenant may
#    point at: the entry says API_KEY, but an install whose server described its
#    own authorization when it was created signs in through a browser and answers
#    OAUTH2 here. Branch on this rather than on the connector's kind." Keying on
#    kind hid Granola from onboarding entirely.
#
# 3. The caller reads `auth_url`; this used to return only `authorization_url`,
#    so the button opened nothing and reported no error. Both are returned now.

# How to install each source we offer, when the organisation has not got it yet.
#
# Gmail, Calendar and Meet are Composio kinds with a system default available, so
# they install with no credentials of our own — the person just signs in.
#
# Granola is deliberately NOT the managed Granola connector: that one is only open
# to Granola's enterprise plan. Everyone on the free plan connects their own MCP
# server instead, which is a plain MCP install pointed at Granola's endpoint.
# Lemma registers itself with that server on creation and the install comes back
# OAUTH2, so the person signs in to their own Granola account like any other source.
