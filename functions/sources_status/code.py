# What the Settings and onboarding screens show: every source this product can read,
# whether it is installed for the org, and whether *you* have connected it.
#
# Being unconnected is a normal state, not an error. Every source is optional and
# skippable — someone with no Granola still gets a working product from mail alone.

# Order is the order they appear. The first three are the onboarding set, and Gmail
# is deliberately first: it is the one source that makes the product work on its own.
# Anything added later lands below them and stays out of onboarding, which should
# never grow into a list somebody has to read.
