# Every table in this pod is row-level secured, so a newly added member starts with a
# genuinely empty app — no tracks, no stages, no voice document. This seeds *their own*
# copy of the defaults.
#
# It runs under the caller's delegated identity, so every row it writes is owned by
# them. It is idempotent: it only creates what is missing, so the app can call it on
# every launch without risk of duplicates.

# Starting points only. Every person runs these differently (or not at all), so the
# defaults are the few steps almost everyone has, with both endings explicit — a single
# "Closed" used to mean both "won" and "they said no". Lem renames and adds stages to match
# the process it actually sees in the person's mail (see the notice skill: "Stages are the
# round's own"), and the refresh autopilot keeps them true.
